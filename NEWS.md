# predictset 0.4.0

This release corrects six defects that affected results, and changes two
defaults. The three headline defects are listed first; the weighted,
Mondrian and Jackknife+/CV+ fixes further down also change what you get
back. Anyone using `conformal_aci()`, `conformal_aps()`, `conformal_raps()`,
or passing a formula or fitted model as `model` should re-run their analysis.

## Bug fixes

* `conformal_aci()` applied the online update with the operands reversed:
  `alpha_t + gamma * (err_t - alpha)` instead of
  `alpha_t + gamma * (alpha - err_t)` (Gibbs and Candes 2021, Eq. 2). A
  miscoverage event therefore narrowed the next interval instead of widening
  it, turning the intended negative feedback into positive feedback, and
  `alpha_t` ran away to a clip boundary. Under a variance shift this drove
  empirical coverage to 0.605 against a 0.90 target.

* The `model` argument was discarded whenever it was a formula or a fitted
  model object, and a plain `lm(y ~ .)` was fitted in its place. `model = y ~ a`
  silently fitted every column of `x`; `lm(y ~ poly(v1, 3) + v2)` was refitted
  as `y ~ v1 + v2`; `ranger` hyperparameters were dropped. Formulas and fitted
  models are now honoured, refitted on each conformal split. Objects that
  cannot be refitted raise an error naming `make_model()` instead of silently
  substituting a default.

* `conformal_aps()` and `conformal_raps()` could return the full label set for
  every observation. The set builder included the class that *crossed* the
  threshold rather than inverting the calibrated score, and `randomize = TRUE`
  randomised the calibration scores but never the set construction. With
  oracle probabilities on a four-class problem, APS returned a mean set size of
  3.90 out of 4 at 99.9% coverage; it now returns 2.69 at 88.6%.

* `conformal_jackknife()`, `conformal_cv()`, and `predict()` clamped the
  interval bounds to the smallest and largest order statistics when the
  quantile index fell outside `1..n`. Barber et al. (2021) define those bounds
  as infinite, which occurs for fewer than 9 observations at `alpha = 0.10`.
  They now return `-Inf` / `Inf`, matching `conformal_split()`.

* `conformal_weighted()` substituted the mean calibration weight for the
  test-point weight, so every test point received the same quantile. The new
  `weights_new` argument gives the exact procedure of Tibshirani et al. (2019),
  in which each test point receives its own quantile. Omitting it with
  non-uniform weights now warns.

* A fitted `glm` passed to any classification method failed with "missing
  columns for class levels", because the internal probability matrix was
  unnamed.

* `coverage_by_bin()` failed with "'breaks' are not unique" whenever
  predictions contained ties. Duplicate breaks are now collapsed, with a
  warning reporting the number of bins actually used.

* Conformal functions called `set.seed()` on the global random stream and left
  it altered. The `seed` argument now applies for the duration of the call
  only, and the user's `.Random.seed` is restored on exit. Seeded calls remain
  reproducible.

* `plot()` failed with "need finite 'ylim' values" on unbounded intervals.
  These are now drawn to the plot edge with a message.

* `conformal_mondrian()` and `conformal_mondrian_class()` silently substituted
  the pooled quantile for groups with fewer than three calibration points,
  voiding the group-conditional guarantee for exactly the groups that needed
  it. Such groups now receive an unbounded interval, with a warning naming the
  number of calibration points required.

* Data frames containing non-numeric columns produced the misleading error
  "must not contain NaN or Inf values". They now name the offending columns
  and suggest `stats::model.matrix()`.

## Changes in default behaviour

* `conformal_aps()` and `conformal_raps()` now default to `randomize = TRUE`,
  the method as published. Deterministic scoring (`randomize = FALSE`) remains
  available and now warns when the conformal quantile saturates at 1. Pass
  `seed` for reproducible randomised sets.

* Prediction sets are now the exact inversion of the calibrated score. New
  `allow_empty` argument on `conformal_lac()`, `conformal_aps()`,
  `conformal_raps()`, `conformal_class_split()`, and
  `conformal_mondrian_class()`; the default `FALSE` keeps the previous
  behaviour of replacing an empty set with the most probable class.

## Other changes

* `conformal_cqr()`'s `quantiles` argument previously had no effect. It is now
  validated, recorded on the returned object, and checked for consistency with
  `alpha`.

* `conformal_cv()` and `conformal_jackknife()` now validate that `x_new` has
  the same number of columns as `x`.

* Jackknife+ prediction makes one call to `predict_fun` per leave-one-out model
  rather than one per (model, test point) pair.

* `conformal_cv(x_new = NULL)` records `train_approximation = TRUE`, and
  `print()` states that those intervals do not carry the CV+ guarantee.

* `inst/CITATION` now reports the installed version rather than a hardcoded one.

* `paper/`, `Makefile`, and `llms*.txt` are excluded from the source tarball,
  which removes an `R CMD check` WARNING about GNU extensions in
  `paper/slides/Makefile` and cuts the tarball from 4.2 MB.

* README and the accompanying paper: corrected the CRAN status, dependency
  count, and competitor versions, and softened the Mondrian and ACI
  exclusivity claims (see `conformalForecast` and `AdaptiveConformal`).

# predictset 0.3.2

* Fixed `predict()` for LAC and Mondrian classification objects: `randomize`
  field now defaults to `FALSE` when not set by the fitting method.

# predictset 0.3.1

* Add DOI links for all DESCRIPTION references per CRAN reviewer feedback.
